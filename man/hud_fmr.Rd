\title{Omni-Query for US Fair Markets Rent API}
\usage{
hud_fmr(
  query,
  year = format(Sys.Date() - 365, "\%Y"),
  key = Sys.getenv("HUD_KEY"),
  to_tibble
)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Can provide either a 5 digit FIPS code + 99999 at end,
state abbreviation, or cbsa (core based statistical area) code.}

\item{year}{Gets the year that this data was recorded.
Can specify multiple years. Default is the
previous year.}

\item{key}{The key obtained from HUD
(US Department of Housing and Urban Development)
USER website.}

\item{to_tibble}{If TRUE, return the data in a tibble format
rather than a data frame.}
}
\value{
This function returns a dataframe or tibble
containing Fair Markets Rent (FMR) data
for a particular county, metroarea, or state. For county and msa level
data,
these measurements include the county_name, counties_msa, town_name,
metro_status, metro_name, smallarea_status, basicdata, Efficiency,
One-Bedroom, Two-Bedroom, Three-Bedroom, Four-Bedroom, and year for zip
code
level data if it considered a small area. Otherwise, data will be returned
at the level of the queried county or metroarea.

For state level data two dataframes will be returned. One for county level
and the other for metroarea level data. These measurements will be the same
as county/metroarea level data.

For more details about these measurements, go to

\description{
This function queries the Fair Markets Rent API provided by
US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD USER). Querying a
state provides a list containing two datasets: one with FMR at a county
level resolution and the other FMR at a metroarea level resolution.
Querying a county or (core based statistical areas) cbsa will provide data
at a zip code resolution
if geographic identifiers are classified as a small area.
