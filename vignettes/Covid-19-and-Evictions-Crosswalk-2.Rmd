## Overview

In the United States, housing advocates and policymakers are concerned that
a sudden disruption in household finances caused by the economic crisis related
to the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a wave of evictions by tenants unable
to pay their rents [(*Cowin, Martin, and Stevens, 2020*)](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/community-development-briefs/db-20200717-measuring-evictions-during-the-covid-19-crisis.aspx). This will
certainly have a dramatic impact on the policies and funding allocated to 
areas of the US.

Viewing [*2016 eviction rankings*](https://evictionlab.org/rankings/#/evictions?r=United%20States&a=0&d=evictionRate&lang=en) for locations across the U.S., Richmond has maintained a 
high eviction rate over the past few years. To understand how the pandemic is 
affecting evictions, I collected weekly eviction filing data for Richmond, which are
provided by [*Princetonâ€™s Eviction Lab*](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/). 

The mapping below uses ggplot and the crosswalk files to 
display COVID-19 cases as well as evictions based on zip codes and
census tracts.

## Loading in the necessary libraries


```r
library(rhud)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)

options (digits=20)
```

<br>

To improve performance, use tigris caching.


```r
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
```

## Reading in data


```r

# Need to move these into the data folder in the R package and 
# should download the shapefile using tigris package instead of loading 
# from disk.

richmond_monthly_2020_2021 <- read_csv("Data/richmond_monthly_2020_2021.csv")
VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode <- read_csv("Data/VA-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-ZIPCode.csv")
richmondBoundary <- st_read("Data/cb_2018_us_zcta510_500k/cb_2018_us_zcta510_500k.shp")

```

<br>

## Cleaning date objects


```r

VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$date <- lubridate::mdy(VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$`Report Date`)

VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$monthYear <- paste(as.character( lubridate::month(VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$date)), "-", as.character( lubridate::year(VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$date)), sep="" )
```

<br> 
 

```r
VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$monthYear <- my(VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$monthYear)

VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$`Number of Cases` <- as.integer(VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode$`Number of Cases`)
```

<br>
 

```r
covidCases <- aggregate(`Number of Cases` ~ monthYear + `ZIP Code`, data = VA_COVID_19_PublicUseDataset_ZIPCode, FUN = sum)
```
 
## Aggregating Racial Majority
 

```r
eviction_race <- aggregate(`filings_2020` ~ month + GEOID + racial_majority,
                           data = richmond_monthly_2020_2021, FUN = sum)

eviction_no_race <- aggregate(`filings_2020` ~ month + GEOID, 
                              data = richmond_monthly_2020_2021, FUN = sum)
```

<br>

## Aggregating Covid Cases


```r
covidCases_spatial <- aggregate(`Number of Cases` ~ `ZIP Code`,
                                FUN = sum, data = covidCases)

covidCases_temporal <- aggregate(`Number of Cases` ~ monthYear,
                                 FUN = sum, data = covidCases)
```

<br>


```r
eviction_no_race_spatial <- aggregate(filings_2020 ~ GEOID,
                                      FUN = sum, data = eviction_no_race)

eviction_no_race_temporal <- aggregate(filings_2020 ~ month,
                                       FUN = sum, data = eviction_no_race)

eviction_no_race_temporal$month <- my(eviction_no_race_temporal$month)

```

<br>

## 


```r
richmond <- inner_join(richmondBoundary,eviction_no_race_spatial, 
                       by = c("ZCTA5CE10" = "GEOID" ))

richmond <- inner_join(richmond,covidCases_spatial, 
                       by = c("ZCTA5CE10" = "ZIP Code" ))
```

<br>

## Mapping COVID cases by zip code


```r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = richmond, aes(fill= `Number of Cases`), size = 0.1, colour = "grey") + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "grey", mid = "white", high = "darkred", labels = comma) +
  ggtitle("Covid-19 Case in Richmond, VA during 2020-2021, by zipcode") +
  coord_sf() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
```

<br>

## Mapping Eviction filings by zip code


```r
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = richmond, aes(fill= `filings_2020`), size = 0.1, colour = "grey") + 
  scale_fill_gradient2() +
  ggtitle("Eviction Case in Richmond, VA during 2020-2021, by zipcode") +
  coord_sf() +

        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
```

          cw_geoid = "tract", cw_geoid_col = "Number of Cases", method = "tot")

evi_cw <- crosswalk(data = a, geoid = "zip", geoid_col = "ZCTA5CE10",
          cw_geoid = "tract", cw_geoid_col = "filings_2020", method = "tot")
```

```r

evi_tract$filings_2020 <- as.integer(evi_tract$filings_2020)

cov_tract <- aggregate(`Number of Cases` ~ tract, FUN = sum, data = covidcases_cw)
cov_tract$`Number of Cases` <- as.integer(cov_tract$`Number of Cases`)
```

        axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),

## Observations
A noteworthy point, the number of COVID and eviction filings is not 
significantly correlated. Meanwhile, crosswalking data from zip codes to census
tracts yielded less accurate results. There appeared to be some discrete or 
even N/A results with COVID cases by census tracts.  

Therefore, it should be noted that there are considerations when crosswalking
data to smaller geographies, particularly census tracts. The fundamental reason
should be the zip codes cross-cut numerous tracts that do not follow the 
boundaries closely.
